# Copepod_starvation_scripts

This repo contains R code and various data files for the companion manuscripts "Comparative analysis of the molecular starvation response of Southern Ocean copepods" by Berger et al. (2023) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.17.553703) and "Nutritional condition drives spatial variation in physiology of Antarctic lipid-storing copepods" by Berger, Steinberg, & Tarrant (in prep). 

Within the starvation paper, there are fodlers for differential expression/WGCNA analyses, comparative analyses (including selection/phylogenetic analyses), and physiolgy (lipids and enzyme activity).
