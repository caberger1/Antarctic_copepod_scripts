This repo contains R code and various data files for the manuscripts "Nutritional condition drives spatial variation in physiology of Antarctic lipid-storing copepods" by Berger, Steinberg, & Tarrant (in prep).
Note that some files have been compressed due to space limitations (zip) and need to be extracted prior to use.

"Env_Data" contains the script and data used to make:
1. Maps of environmental data and copepods abundances (Environmental_Parameter_Maps_Fig1.R; Figs 1 and S1 of original submission)
2. Depth profiles of enviromental measurements (CTD_plots_Fig2.R; Fig. 2 of original submission)
3. Heat map with correlations among environmental parameters and copepod abundances (CorrPlot_Fig3.R; Fig. 3 of original submission)

"Transcriptome" contains
1. The script (PCA_plots_Fig4.R) and data to make the PCA plot (Fig. 4).
2. Scripts and files needed to identify differentially expressed genes between stations or station groups.

"Physiology" contains the script and data to plot food in gut, reproductive stage and citrate synthase (Fig 5 of original submission). 

"WGCNA" contains scripts and files necessary to test for associations of environmental measurements with WGCNA modules and to make associated heat maps:
* Calanoides acutus (WGCNA_Acutus.R; Figure 6)
* Calanus propinquus (WGCNA_Propinquus.R; Figure 8)
