This folder contains scripts and most data associated with 

"Env_Data" contains the script and data used to make:
1. Maps of environmental data and copepods abundances (Environmental_Parameter_Maps_Fig1.R; Figs 1 and S1 of original submission)
2. Depth profiles of enviromental measurements (CTD_plots_Fig2.R; Fig. 2 of original submission)
3. Heat map with correlations among environmental parameters and copepod abundances (CorrPlot_Fig3.R; Fig. 3 of original submission)

"Transcriptome" contains
1. The script (PCA_plots_Fig4.R) and data to make the PCA plot (Fig. 4).
*** THIS IS IN PROGRESS. Still need to upload the scripts that do the DE analysis. 

"Physiology" contains the script and data to plot food in gut, reproductive stage and citrate synthase (Fig 5 of original submission). 

"WGCNA" contains scripts and files necessary to test for associations of environmental measurements with WGCNA modules and to make associated heat maps:
* Calanoides acutus (WGCNA_Acutus.R; Figure 6)
* Calanus propinquus (WGCNA_Propinquus.R; Figure 8)
